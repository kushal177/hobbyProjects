PageFaultCalculation- This program calculates the number of major page faults, minor page faults when a simpleimage processing application is executed.This program runs on Lunux 3.6 kernel and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

RegionGrowing- This programs performs region growing on pixels with same intensity(or given condition) using seeded region growing method. Both Matlab and C implementations are present here.The C program uses opencv 2.4.9 for basic operations like opening and saving an image file.

Segregation- This is a simple program to segregate two kinds of objects effectively.

Clustering- This is a small program to perform clustering the given data. It used k-means clustering. However, the technique used to find the number of clusters is using variance and normalisation technique.Python is used as the base language and scipy's k-Means clustering is used. However, the clustered points are also displayed in graphs using matplotlib.

AffineTransformationMatrixCalc- This is a small program to find the affine transformation matrix between source points and destintion points. Python is used as the base language and scipy's Least Square Error algorithms is used for calculating affine transformation matrix.Finally, the program shows a plot of destination points and calculated destination points and the error values.

PythonTrainingMaterial- This folder consists a set of small programs that I used to learn python. These program are modifications of the sample programs from the book "Building Machine Learning Systems with Python", author- Willi Richert & Luis Pedro Coelho.

DSA- This folder consists of variuos tutorial projects.
Tutorial_1-> some examples on member function pointers, 
swapping nibbles, vector/map containers. etc.
Tutorial_2->consists of some of the basic operations of single linked list like, reversing a linked-list, finding whether linked list is cyclic or not etc.It has got some BST implmentations for finding number of leaf nodes.This folder can be used as cheatsheet before attending an interview on DSA or C++ ;)
